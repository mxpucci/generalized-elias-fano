      # which allows us to produce a fully static binary (-static) that runs on CentOS 7
      # without depending on its outdated glibc. We mount the workspace into the container
      # and install build tools via apk. The compilation uses aggressive optimisation
      # flags and targets the user’s Xeon Gold 6140M CPU. The resulting binary is
      # statically linked (`-static`) so it should run on the CentOS VM regardless of
      # the glibc version.
